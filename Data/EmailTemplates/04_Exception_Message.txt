Process Name:  Visa Pay Arena process
Department:    Electronic Product OperationsDear Team,

Dear Team,

While attempting to run PayArena Settlement process, I encountered the following error:

ExceptionMessage

These error can fix in two ways:

1. Go to the process config settings and change date to match the date
   in the processing report file to finished the pending job.

2. Go the processing folder and delete the processing report name [PAYArena_WorkLog] to start a new job.

NB: No 2, the pending task will be lost. No 1 is recommended.

Please do any of the above option and retry.

Best Regards

Dear Team,

Be inform that I notices there is a saved job running before, the date is: [OldDate]. 
The date set in the orchestrator is: [NewDate].

The bot is already using the date: [OldDate] to run the Job, please ignore this mail if you are okay with it. 

If you intend using the date set in the orchestrator: [NewDate], please stop the process and navigate to the processing folder to delete both the tracker and worklog excel file.
N.B: The saved job running before will be lost, if you delete the files.

Regards,
